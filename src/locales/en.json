We have realized that way too often we tend to focus on “things to do” at the destination, while forgetting if they are “the right things to do”. Welcome to Sicily will help you find the local experts that suit your needs and expectations. No more averages or ratings, Welcome to Sicily is all about finding the people you like and trust. Once you are connected with them you can easily chat with them on your favorite messaging apps such as Telegram or Whatsapp."

You’ll be able to browse through their videos and photos to find the ones you like and trust the most. You can add up between 4 and 9 different ambassadors to your team. Once you feel like your team is set, simply select the messaging app you like to use and we will create a group chat with the ambassadors you have chosen. There are no limits in terms of how many messages you can send or things that you want to ask. Just browse, select and start chatting right away."

Ambassadors are people who deeply care about the places you’ll visit, and things you’ll do. They are willing to help you because they believe that there is so much more to be discovered than what you get to see on travel guides, blogs or websites."

The same applies to your mobile number in case you use WhatsApp: we simply need it to add you to the chat. Once your trip is over we’ll delete your phone number from any property we may possess. If you prefer to keep your info completely private we have added Telegram as a viable option to not reveal your identity."
