I have grown up having a “granita ca brioscia” (a typical Sicilian breakfast) by the Athena temple in Siracusa and enjoying bonfires by the crystal clear sea in one of the amazing beaches along the coast. I've been living in the UK and in the north of Italy, but there is absolutely such no place as Sicily: the breeze is different!!! The seaside, the typical food, the trails with breathtaking landscapes, experiences that cannot be summoned up in any word… If you want to feel Sicily the way a Sicilian girl would, I am here to give you tips!

I love nature in all its forms, I love jogging and I am a scuba diving addicted. Nevertheless I love cooking, in particular, Sicilian cuisine greatly stimulates my appetite and my interests. I feel the expression of the culinary art developed since ancient times is closely connected to the historical, cultural and religious events of the island.",

The beautiful crystal clear sea, the smell of the homemade sugo at mezzogiorno on a Sunday and that intense August heat which was the perfect excuse for a granita col brioche, are my first memories of Sicily. My family decided to move and build a house in the  Sicilian countryside when I was 8 years old. A decision which not only gave me the opportunity to learn a second language, but most importantly allowed me to experience the little things that make Sicily such a beautiful place to live on a daily basis. If you want to know the best restaurants, ice cream shops, beaches and Sicilian adventures give me a shout.",

I'm a travel lover, a culture enthusiast..and a food discoverer. Since I was young I've been using every free moment to explore new countries, new cultures and traditions. I spent one year living in Germany, I visited more than 20 different countries in Europe and outside. Now I’ve been living in Milan for 7 years but every opportunity is good to go back home and have a good Granita ca' brioscia as breakfast. You still don't know what am I talking about? Well, don't be shy, Sicily is waiting for you!",
