It is just stunning how strolling around each and every city you will notice how the same pattern keeps repeating Greek, Romans, Norman and other populations that have followed. I have grown up having a “granita ca brioscia” (a typical Sicilian breakfast) by the Athena temple in Siracusa and enjoying bonfires by the crystal clear sea in one of the amazing beaches along the coast. I've been living in the UK and in the north of Italy, but there is absolutely such no place as Sicily: the breeze is different!!! The seaside, the typical food, the trails with breathtaking landscapes, experiences that cannot be summoned up in any word… If you want to feel Sicily the way a Sicilian girl would, I am here to give you tips!
